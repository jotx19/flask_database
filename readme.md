## Setup Instructions

To run the project on your local machine, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Set up a Virtual Environment

Make sure you're in the project directory, then run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask
```

### Troubleshooting

If the above steps donâ€™t work on your machine, follow these instructions to reset your virtual environment:

1. **Deactivate the virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

2. **Remove the existing virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   rm -rf .venv
   ```

3. **Recreate and activate the virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
   ```

4. **Reinstall the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

After completing these steps, the virtual environment should be set up correctly.

This format should make it clear for anyone following the README to set up their environment on both Windows and macOS/Linux systems.
