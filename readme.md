## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set up `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Activate your virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask
```

If `pip` doesn't work, follow the troubleshooting steps below.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, reset your virtual environment:

1. **Deactivate the virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

2. **Remove the existing virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   rm -rf .venv
   ```

3. **Recreate and activate the virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
   ```

4. **Reinstall dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

This should cover the basic steps for setting up the `.env` and installing Flask with minimal instructions.
